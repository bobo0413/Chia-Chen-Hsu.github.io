## About Me

Hi there! My name is Chia-Chen Hsu, and I am a second-year PhD student in the EEFE program. My advisor is Prof. Katherine Y. Zipp, and we are studying consumers’ willingness to pay for carbon-smart labels in the dairy market. My other research interests include topics related to animal welfare. Recently, I have been estimating the impact of banning pet retailers from selling pets on dog welfare. I am taking this class because causal inference is both important and widely applicable, and there is always more to learn in this area. I am excited to further develop my skills in this course.
