    "text": "This project examines how carbon-neutral milk influences consumer choice, willingness to pay, and greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. retail milk market. Using real-world retail sales data, the analysis evaluates whether carbon-neutral labeling leads to changes in consumption behavior or primarily reallocates demand across existing milk categories, thereby shedding light on the economic and environmental effectiveness of sustainability labels in food markets.\n\n\nTo what extent does carbon-neutral milk reshape consumer choice and willingness to pay, and does this shift translate into meaningful greenhouse gas emission reductions in the U.S. retail milk market?\n\n\n\nThe analysis uses NielsenIQ retail scanner data from 2021 to 2023.\n\n\n\nConsumer demand is estimated using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) to capture substitution patterns and expenditure effects across milk products. Counterfactual simulations are then conducted to recover diversion ratios and willingness-to-pay measures, which are combined with emissions intensity estimates to assess the implied climate impacts of changes in consumption.\n\n\n\nPreliminary results suggest a rebound effect: increased consumption of carbon-neutral milk is associated with substitution away from organic milk and plant-based alternatives, alongside an increase in non-organic milk consumption. While carbon-neutral milk expansion is linked to reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions, these reductions appear to be concentrated among a subset of consumers rather than broadly distributed across the market."

    "text": "This project examines how carbon-neutral milk influences consumer choice, willingness to pay, and greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. retail milk market. Using real-world retail sales data, the analysis evaluates whether carbon-neutral labeling leads to changes in consumption behavior or primarily reallocates demand across existing milk categories, thereby shedding light on the economic and environmental effectiveness of sustainability labels in food markets.\n\n\nTo what extent does carbon-neutral milk reshape consumer choice and willingness to pay, and does this shift translate into meaningful greenhouse gas emission reductions in the U.S. retail milk market?\n\n\n\nThe analysis uses NielsenIQ retail scanner data from 2021 to 2023.\n\n\n\nConsumer demand is estimated using a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) to capture substitution patterns and expenditure effects across milk products. Counterfactual simulations are then conducted to recover diversion ratios and willingness-to-pay measures, which are combined with emissions intensity estimates to assess the implied climate impacts of changes in consumption.\n\n\n\nPreliminary results suggest a rebound effect: increased consumption of carbon-neutral milk is associated with substitution away from organic milk and plant-based alternatives, alongside an increase in non-organic milk consumption. While carbon-neutral milk expansion is linked to reductions in total greenhouse gas emissions, these reductions appear to be concentrated among a subset of consumers rather than broadly distributed across the market."
